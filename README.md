- CSS Grid
- Java script

### What I learned

USo, I‚Äôve been messing around with JavaScript lately, and honestly, it's like giving my site a shot of espresso‚Äîit‚Äôs all animated and interactive now! No more boring static pages, everything‚Äôs moving and grooving, making the whole thing look way more legit.

On top of that, I finally started getting cozy with CSS Grid. I used to be all about Flexbox like it was my safety blanket, but now Grid and I? We‚Äôre pretty tight. Less ‚Äúwait, what?‚Äù moments and more ‚ÄúI got this.‚Äù

Oh, and I learned how to throw in modal windows like a pro. Seriously, it‚Äôs a game-changer‚Äîespecially for mobile users. Pop-ups have never been so satisfying.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I'm planning to dive deeper into JavaScript and really level up those interactive elements‚Äîwho doesn‚Äôt love a good hover effect or smooth transition, right? I'm also on a mission to make Grid my BFF (sorry Flexbox, you‚Äôre still cool, though). The goal is to get super comfortable with both so I can whip up layouts like a pro without a second guess.

Also, I want to explore more advanced stuff, like making custom modals and perfecting responsive designs. Gotta make sure everything looks üî• on mobile too. Oh, and maybe start playing around with some animations to give the site that extra ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor.

Oh, and mark my words: my next project will be written with SASS for sure. No more excuses‚Äîjust cleaner, faster CSS like a boss! üòé
